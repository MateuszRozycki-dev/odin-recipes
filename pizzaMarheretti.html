    <h1><strong>Recipe 1: Classic Margherita Pizza
</strong></h1>
    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <br>
    <p>Chicken Tikka Masala is a globally beloved curry, famous for its tender chunks of chicken (tikka) marinated in yogurt and spices, then simmered in a rich, creamy, and mildly spiced tomato-based sauce (masala). While its exact origins are debated, it's widely considered a staple of British Indian cuisine, offering a comforting blend of flavors that appeals to many palates.

The beauty of this dish lies in the interplay of smoky, marinated chicken with the aromatic, velvety sauce, often made with ingredients like ginger, garlic, garam masala, and a touch of cream or yogurt for richness. It's a hearty and satisfying meal, perfect served with basmati rice or warm naan bread.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h2>For the Chicken Marinade:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g (1.1 lbs) boneless, skinless chicken breast or thigh, cut into 1-inch cubes
</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) plain yogurt
</li>
        <li>1 tbsp grated fresh ginger
</li>
        <li>1 tbsp minced garlic
</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin
</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground coriander
</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp turmeric powder
</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong> In a bowl, combine chicken cubes with all marinade ingredients. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or preferably 2-4 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Chicken: </strong> Heat a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Cook the marinated chicken in batches until lightly browned and cooked through. Set aside. (You can also broil or grill the chicken for a more authentic "tikka" flavor.)</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong> In the same skillet (or a separate pot), melt butter or ghee over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 5-7 minutes.</li>

    </ol>
