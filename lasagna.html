    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish from Rome, made with eggs, hard cheese, cured pork (guanciale or pancetta), and black pepper. The rich, creamy sauce is created by emulsifying the eggs and cheese with the hot pasta water, forming a luscious coating without the need for cream. It's a quick, satisfying, and incredibly flavorful meal that's perfect for a weeknight dinner or a special occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Authentic Carbonara relies on simple, high-quality ingredients and precise technique. The key is to cook the pasta al dente, render the pork until crispy, and master the emulsion for that perfect silky texture.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g (7 oz) spaghetti or bucatini</li>
        <li>100g (3.5 oz) guanciale or pancetta, diced</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks + 1 whole egg</li>
        <li>50g (1/2 cup) Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated (plus extra for serving)</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Salt for pasta water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil for the pasta.</li>
        <li>While the water heats, prepare your guanciale/pancetta: Cook the diced pork in a cold pan over medium-low heat. Render slowly until crispy and golden. Remove the crispy bits (ciccioli) to a plate lined with paper towel, leaving the rendered fat in the pan.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, whole egg, and grated Pecorino Romano cheese until smooth and creamy. Season generously with freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook the spaghetti in the boiling water according to package directions until al dente. Before draining, reserve about 1 to 1.5 cups of the starchy pasta water.</li>
        <li>Drain the spaghetti, but do not rinse. Immediately add the hot, drained spaghetti to the pan with the rendered guanciale/pancetta fat. Toss well to coat.</li>
        <li>Working quickly, remove the pan from the heat (this is crucial to prevent scrambling the eggs). Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta.</li>
        <li>Immediately begin tossing vigorously with tongs, adding a splash of the reserved hot pasta water a little at a time. Continue tossing and stirring until the sauce emulsifies and forms a smooth, creamy coating around the pasta. Add more pasta water if needed to reach desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Stir in most of the crispy guanciale/pancetta bits.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, garnished with extra Pecorino Romano, more freshly ground black pepper, and the remaining crispy guanciale/pancetta. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
